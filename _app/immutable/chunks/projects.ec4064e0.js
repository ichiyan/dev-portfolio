						key consists of the modulus n and a public exponent, e. The private key consists of the modulus n and the private exponent d, which can be calculated using 
						the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the multiplicative inverse with respect to the totient of n. The modular exponentiation to e and d corresponds to

					a <b>monitored forum</b> is accessible within the app. Through the forum,  users can share their experiences, give tips, consult with 
					professionals, and be part of a community that aims to promote financial education. This section will offer various incentives 
					for the financial professionals so that they will be encouraged to contribute and help those who are in the process of
