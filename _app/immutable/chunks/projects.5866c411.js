					  for brain-computer interfaces. With the success of state-of-the-art latent diffusion models in image synthesis, 
					  a trend in recent studies is to map fMRI recordings to the image embedding space of these generative models. 
					  While this method significantly improved image reconstructions in terms of semantics, preserving perceptual features 
					  without losing semantic information remains challenging, especially with complex images of natural scenes. 
					  This research introduces Neuro-Vis, a novel fMRI-to-image pipeline based on Stable Diffusion that effectively integrates 
					  multiple semantic controls through predicted image embeddings and captions and multiple lightweight perceptual controls 
					  through predicted blurry initial images, depth maps, and color palettes. Neuro-Vis outperforms the current state-of-the-art
